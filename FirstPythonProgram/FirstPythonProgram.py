# Comments 

# Comments are started with a Sign " # " for single line comment 

# This is single line comment 

#print( " Moni ")      -----> This is code to print Moni

# We can also make multiline comments  as follows 

"""

# Variables 
 
# Variables do not need to be declared with any particular data type, and can even change type after they have been set.

x=5
y="moni"
z=3.5
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

x= int(3)
y= str ("ali")
z= float (4.6)
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

# we can also check the data types of the variables by  " Type function "
 
print (type(x))
print (type(y))
print (type(z))
